# introduction to DSP - final project
In the project we were asked to process an image in order to reveal the alien from Mars. 
By using DFT we found the noise frequency.
We designed a notch filter to elimnate the noise and passed the image through it.
In the end we designed a system to correct the distortion,
passed the image through it again and than we got the clean image.
